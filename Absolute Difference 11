/*program
You are given a function,
int findCount(int arr[], int length, int num, int diff);
The function accepts an integer array ‘arr’, its length and two integer variables ‘num’ and ‘diff’.
Implement this function to find and return the number of elements of ‘arr’ having an absolute difference of less than or equal to ‘diff’ with ‘num’.
Note: In case there is no element in ‘arr’ whose absolute difference with ‘num’ is less than or equal to ‘diff’, return -1.
Input Format:
n - No.of elements array of n elements number - num difference - diff
Constraints:No Constraints
Output Format:
Count of absolute numbers
Sample Input 0:
6
12 3 14 56 77 13
13
2
Sample Output 0:
3
Explanation 0:
Elements of ‘arr’ having absolute difference of less than or equal to ‘diff’ i.e. 2 with ‘num’ i.e. 13 are 12, 13 and 14.
